<h2>Deep Roots</h2><p>Cumming Group was established in the US in 1996 by UK born Finlay Cumming.

Cumming Group&rsquo;s team are comprised of 450+ professionals offering bespoke, principal-led services from offices in Ireland, the United Kingdom, and Europe. Now operating as one seamless organisation, Cumming Group delivers superior value and problem-solving on a wide range of large and complex schemes.</p><h2>The Expansion of Cumming Group in Europe</h2>From 1996, when Finlay Cumming first formed the organisation in the US, up until today, we have worked hard to continuously innovate and evolve. By hiring the most talented and hardest working professionals we could find, and then by merging with like-minded UK-based firms who placed a similar emphasis on client service and satisfaction, we further realised Finlay&rsquo;s vision to become a leading global consultancy.
