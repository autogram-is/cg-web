<p class="is-style-lede-header">Since founding Cumming Group in 1996, we have remained steadfast in our commitment to growing the company.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have sought to steadily increase the company’s breadth of services, as well its geographic reach across the U.S. and abroad. Cumming Group’s exceptional growth — nearly doubling in size every three to four years — has been achieved through the company’s continuous focus on our clients and culture, as well as through a series of strategic partnerships and mergers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since early 2018, Cumming Group has joined with some of the most successful and widely respected firms across the U.S. and Europe. These companies now operate as standalone divisions of Cumming Group, offering clients in their respective regions increased access to the full extent of Cumming Group’s resources and capabilities, from our deep bench of talented professionals to our expertise across a wide range of sectors and services.</p>
