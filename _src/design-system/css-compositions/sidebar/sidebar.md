A layout that allows for a flexible main content area and a “fixed” width sidebar that sits on the left or right. If there is not enough viewport space to fit both the sidebar _and_ the main content minimum width, they will stack on top of each other.

By default the first item in source order is the sidebar; when modified with `.swap` the second item in source order is the sidebar.
