Note that these statistics should not make use of `sup` elements, as the superscript type treatments are strictly stylistic, rather than semantically meaningful (eg. flagging content as a footnote marker).

> These elements must be used only to mark up typographical conventions with specific meanings, not for typographical presentation for presentation's sake.
