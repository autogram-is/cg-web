## Markup Notes

### `address`
The `address` element provides a wrapper element for all contact information associated with either a document (if it has a parent `body` or `article` element) or portion of a document (if it has a parent `section` or `role="region"` element). Information provided by `address` may include the names of the document’s maintainers, links to the maintainers’ Web pages, e-mail addresses for feedback, postal addresses, phone numbers, and so on.

See [4.3.10 The address element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-address-element) in the HTML Living Standard.
