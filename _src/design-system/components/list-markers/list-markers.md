Note that these are the default styles for all `ul` and `ol` site-wide, with the exception of `ul[role="list"]` and `ol[role="list"]`. As these work by restyling native `::marker` pseudoelements, their [semantic meaning](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/01/12/lists-and-safari.html) is retained by default. For the sake of consistency across combinations of browser and assistive technology—a lsit of navigation or menu items, for example—`ul`/`ol` should always have a `role="list"` attribute.
